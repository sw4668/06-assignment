this project, despite being similar to setting reminders on your phone, felt more exciting- maybe due to this ikea effect. Since we coded the reminders ourselves and were able to customize the icons, it felt more personal and, oddly, more encouraging. Receiving the pushover notifications made me more inclined to follow the instructions than receiving messages from the reminders app on our phones.

One struggle i had at was figuring out how to get the notifications to stop. I had set one to send every one second to test if it would work after troubleshooting with github and digital ocean (i duplicated the whole thing because i put it in the wrong folder originally). The spamming of notifications quickly got old and it took me way to long to think to ask chatgpt how to stop them. I felt pretty dumb but also quite glad that stopping them was as simple as clicking control C.
